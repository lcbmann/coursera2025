- Updated environment.yml to the minimal coursera-geophysics environment suitable for Binder and local runs.
- Wrapped single-sample animation markers in W3 and W4 helpers with sequences so Matplotlib accepts them during HTML export.
- Swapped notebook animation embeds to use ani.to_html5_video() everywhere to avoid frontend "IPython is not defined" errors.
- Marked LaTeX-rich matplotlib labels in W2_P1 as raw strings to suppress invalid escape warnings.
