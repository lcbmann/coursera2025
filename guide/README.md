# Guide to Using `ProgressBarHandler` and `FuncAnimation`

## Using `ProgressBarHandler`

`ProgressBarHandler` is a utility for tracking progress and providing a visual indicator during task execution.

### Steps to Use:
1. **Initialization**:  
   Create an instance by specifying:
   - The total number of steps.
   - A message to display.
   - Whether the progress bar should remain after completion.

   ```python
   animation_progress_handler = ProgressBarHandler(total_steps, "Task Message...", remain_after_finish=False)
   ```

2. **Update Progress**:  
    Call the handler with the current step to update the progress bar.

    ```python
    animation_progress_handler(current_step)
    ```

## Using `FuncAnimation` from `matplotlib.animation`

`FuncAnimation` is a tool for creating dynamic animations by repeatedly calling an update function.

### Steps to Use:
1. **Set Up the Plot**:
   - Create a figure and axes using `matplotlib.pyplot`.
   - Initialize any plot elements (e.g., lines) to be updated.

   ```python
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   line, = ax.plot([], [])
   ```

2. **Define the Update Function**:  
   This function should take a frame number and update the properties of the plot elements.
   ```python
   def update(frame, line):
       line.set_ydata(data[frame])
       return line,
   ```

3. **Create the Animation**:  
   Use `FuncAnimation` to tie the figure, update function, and animation parameters together.
   ```python
   ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=total_frames, fargs=(line,), interval=50)
   ```
   - `frames`: Number of frames or a generator for frame indices.
   - `fargs`: Additional arguments passed to the update function.
   - `interval`: Time (in milliseconds) between frames.

4. **Convert to HTML Player**:  
   ```python
   display(HTML(ani.to_html5_video()))
   ```

## Use of `locals()`

`locals()` is a built-in Python function that returns a dictionary of the current local symbol table, providing access to all variables and their values within the current scope.

### How It's Used in the Code:
In the provided example, variables like `fig1`, `ax1`, `line2`, etc., are passed to the function using a dictionary (`local_dict`) that mimics the output of `locals()`.

### Benefits of Using `locals()`:
1. **Compact Code**:  
   Instead of passing each variable individually to a function, you can pass a dictionary of all local variables.

   ```python
   create_animation_fe_static_elasticity(locals())
   ```

2. **Dynamic Handling**:  
   Functions can dynamically access variables without knowing their names in advance.

### Caution When Using `locals()`:
- Avoid modifying the returned dictionary, as changes might not always reflect in the actual local variables.
- Use `locals()` primarily for read access or passing context to functions for better maintainability.
