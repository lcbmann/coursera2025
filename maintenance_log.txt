Notebook Maintenance Log
========================

2025-10-10 (UTC) - Automated Review
- Updated W2/W2_P1 derivative plots to use raw Matplotlib strings for LaTeX text so Python no longer emits invalid escape warnings.
- Added a raw-string ylabel in W5/W5_ps_cheby_derivative_solution to avoid invalid escape warnings for $\partial_x f(x)$.
- Patched W3/animation.py to supply one-point sequences to the marker update in create_animation_gaussian_analytical, preventing "x must be a sequence" errors during HTML animation export.
- Attempted to install runtime dependencies inside the CI container, but outbound package downloads are blocked by the execution environment's proxy (documented for debugging).
